Pupil is my design of a student profile portal for NITK and potentially connecting students across all interested engineering colleges.

The idea is that we connect Pupil with an existent student management system of a college which handles students' academics like iris. Then we let people from various clubs register and authenticate themselves as the actual executives of the club so that they can establish their presence on pupil.
